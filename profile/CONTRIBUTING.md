## 🙌 Ways to Contribute

### 🎨 UI/UX Design *(Community Web UI — most needed)*
No code experience required for this one. We need designers who can:
- Improve page layouts, spacing, and visual consistency
- Create or refine a mobile-friendly design
- Suggest or build out a component/design system
- Improve accessibility (contrast, font sizes, keyboard nav)

If you're a designer, open an issue with your ideas or share mockups in our Discord before building — we love to see concepts early.

### 🖥 Frontend Development *(Community Web UI)*
- Connect UI components to backend API endpoints
- Improve error handling, loading states, and empty states
- Add missing features (profile pages, post detail, etc.)
- Write or improve tests
- General bug fixes and cleanup

### ⚙️ Backend Development *(Dwahfy-Core)*
- Bug fixes and performance improvements
- New API endpoints or improvements to existing ones
- Docker / self-hosting improvements
- Security improvements
- Writing or improving API documentation

### 📝 Documentation
- Improve the README or this contributing guide
- Write setup guides, self-hosting walkthroughs, or API docs
- Fix typos or clarify confusing sections

### 🐛 Bug Reports
Found something broken? Open an issue — see [Issue Guidelines](#issue-guidelines) below.

### 💡 Feature Suggestions
Have an idea? Open a GitHub Discussion or bring it up in Discord before building it, so we can align on direction first.

## 🚦 Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues and PRs** to make sure someone isn't already working on the same thing.
2. **For large changes**, open an issue or discuss in Discord first. This saves everyone time.
3. **For small fixes** (typos, minor bugs), feel free to just open a PR directly.

## 🔀 How to Submit a Pull Request

```bash
# 1. Fork the repo and clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
cd REPO_NAME

# 2. Create a new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix

# 3. Make your changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: short description of what you did"

# 4. Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# 5. Open a Pull Request on GitHub
```

### PR Tips
- Keep PRs focused — one feature or fix per PR
- Write a clear description of what you changed and why
- Link any related issues (e.g. `Closes #42`)
- Screenshots or screen recordings are very helpful for UI changes

---

## 🐛 Issue Guidelines

When opening a bug report, please include:
- A clear title and description
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Your environment (OS, browser, Node version, etc.)
- Screenshots if relevant

When opening a feature request, please include:
- What problem it solves
- What you'd like to see
- Any examples or references

---

## 🧹 Code Style

- **Backend (Dwahfy-Core):** Follow existing code conventions. Use clear variable names and add comments where logic isn't obvious.
- **Frontend (Community Web UI):** TypeScript is required. Keep components small and focused. Follow existing file/folder structure.
- Run any linters or formatters before submitting (`npm run lint` if available).
